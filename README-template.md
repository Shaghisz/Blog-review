## Overview

  It's a good exercise to practise image positioning.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

 I think it really challenged me on the shadow - position and the border radius.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 ; 
}
```

### Continued development

 I want to learn more on animations based on scrolls.
